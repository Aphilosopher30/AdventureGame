# README

This is intended to be a web based version of the Incan Gold Game.


- Start with single player game
- make we page that has a button. The button will put up a random number between 1 and 10.
  - Save the number to the point counter.
  - distinguish between potential points and all points earned through all rounds.
- add in hazards.
  - when one hazard is chosen, round ends. All points lost
  - when two hazards are chosen,  round ends. All points lost
  - make different hazards
  - the two hazards have to match for round to end.
- make it act like a deck of cards  

- make one button into two buttons for Stay or Leave  
  - if you stay, draw another card and repeat.
  - if you leave, save number of points accumulated


- make multiplayer games.
- We need users, or rather players.
  - Each player needs to be able to enter a Game
  - they need a name
  - they will need a password I expect. But that's not a priority early on.
