# README

This is intended to be a web based version of the Incan Gold Game.


- Start with single player game
-  



- make multiplayer games.
- We need users, or rather players.
  - Each player needs to be able to enter a Game
  - they need a name
  - they will need a password i expect. but that's not a priority early on.
