# README

This is intended to be a web based version of the Incan Gold Game.


- Start with single player game
- make we page that has a button. The button will put up a random number between 1 and 10.
- add in hazards
- make it act like a deck of cards  




- make multiplayer games.
- We need users, or rather players.
  - Each player needs to be able to enter a Game
  - they need a name
  - they will need a password i expect. but that's not a priority early on.
